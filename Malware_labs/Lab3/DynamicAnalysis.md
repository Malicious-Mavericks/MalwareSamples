# Lab 3: Dynamic Analysis
## Lab 3-1
### Questions
1. What are this malware’s imports and strings?
2. What are the malware’s host-based indicators?
3. Are there any useful network-based signatures for this malware? If so, what are they?
### Imports and strings
Checking PEiD to see if the binary is packed.

![lab03-01 peid packed](../../Images/lab03-01_packed.png)

The binary does appear to be packed with PEncyrpt 3.1

Checking PEStudio for imports and strings:

![lab03-01 pestudio imports](../../Images/lab03-01_imports.png)

![lab03-01 pestudio strings1](../../Images/lab03-01_strings1.png)

![lab03-01 pestudio strings2](../../Images/lab03-01_strings2.png)

The lack of imports is another indicator that this binary was packed.

### Host-based indicators

Looking into the strings we noticed a few registry keys including `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` which means the program is trying to get persistance. The `vmx32to64.exe` is more likely the name of the malware.

### Network-based indicators

Looking at [CONNECT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/CONNECT) for http, we can see that it is an HTTP method for creating two-way communications as a tunnel. The URL that is present in the strings is www[.]practicalmalwareanalysis[.]com

## Lab 3-2
### Questions
1. How can you get this malware to install itself?
2. How would you get this malware to run after installation?
3. How can you find the process under which this malware is running?
4. Which filters could you set in order to use procmon to glean information?
5. What are the malware’s host-based indicators?
6. Are there any useful network-based signatures for this malware?
