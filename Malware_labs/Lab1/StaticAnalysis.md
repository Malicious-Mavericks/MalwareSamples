# Static Analysis of Lab 1 
## Lab 1-1
Objectives for the first sample of malware:
1. Upload the files to [Virtus Total](http://www.VirusTotal.com/) and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
2. When were these files compiled?
3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?
4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?
6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?
7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?

### VirusTotal Results
To begin the static analysis of, the textbook recommends to first take a hash of the `.exe` and `.dll` files. This will provide the analyst with a hash that can be search on the internet and possibly provide more useful infomration about the files and virus. 

Using HashMyFiles we were able to find the hashes of `Lab01-01.exe` and `Lab01-01.dll` 

![Lab01-01.dll hash](../../Images/lab01-01-dll.png)  

![Lab01-01.exe hash](../../Images/lab01-01-exe.png)

Using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) we are able to use the search feature and copy and paste the MD5 hashes of the files.

![VirusTotal search](../../Images/VirusTotal_search.png)

The `Lab01-01.dll` file got a hit:

![VirusTotal Lab01-01.dll](../../Images/VT_lab01-01-dll.png)

The `Lab01-01.exe` file also got a hit:

![VirusTotal Lab01-01.exe](../../Images/VT_lab01-01-exe.png)

<!-- ![MD5 Hash Lab1](../../Images/MD5_Hash_Lab1.PNG)

This hash can be searched for on the [Virus Total Webiste](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search)


![Virus Total Search](../../Images/virusTotalHashSearch.PNG)

However, the virus total website search tool is not supported in Windows XP. I chose to proceed with Virus Total scan through Virus Total Scanner Application which is still supported on Windows XP.

![Virus Total Scanner Results](../../Images/VirusTotalScannerLab1-1.PNG)

The search did not provide any useful information as the hash was not known to Virus Total. Entering the hash into the website search tool on a different system also did not provide any results.  -->

### Compiled Times
The lab then asks when this file was compiled. To do this we will use a tool called PEview. 

First look at the file with PEview with an omninous warning message- spooky :ghost:. 

![Warning characters data](../../Images/warning_string.PNG)

The compile time is locate in the image file headers. Compile Time: 2010/12/19 16:16:19 UTC

![PEview Compile Time](../../Images/PEview_compileTime.PNG)

### To Pack or not to Pack that is the question
The next step is to determine if the file is packed. I downloaded the PEid program to assist with this from (https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Packers-Crypters-Protectors/PEiD-updated.shtml). After installing this program, I was able to select the executable file to scan. The resulsts indicated that this file was not packed but used Microsoft Visual C++ as a compiler. This was true for both the `.exe` and `.dll` files. 

![PEid result](../../Images/PEid_result.PNG)

### Imported Files
Question 4 wants us to look at the imports of the files. Using PEStudios we were able to view the different imports. One of the nice things about PEStudios is that it will flag different imports that are usually found in Malware!

Looking at the `.dll` file we see the following imports:

![libraries dll](../../Images/libraries_lab01-01-dll.png)

Examining the libraries it seems that this malware opens a socket to connect to something as well as creates a new process. 

Looking at the `.exe` file we see the following imports:

![libraries exe](../../Images/libraries_lab01-01-exe.png)

Examining the libraries it seems that this malware is going through files and looking into [UnmapViewOfFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-unmapviewoffile) import we see that this will allow the memory space of the file to be overwritten. So potentially a ransomware, since it also maps the view of the file. I would assume this would be to allow the user to gain access to their files again after paying the ransom.

### Other host-based indicators
Looking at the strings of the `.exe` file we notice a `kerne132.dll` which seems to be changing the l for a 1 on the regular `KERNEL32.dll` file. It may be trying to hide itself in plain sight.

![lab01-01.exe kernel32.dll](../../Images/lab01-01-exe%20kernel32.png)

### Network-based indicators
Looking at the strings for `.dll` file we notice an IP address. This is important, since we saw in the imports it was creating a connection. We now know it was more likely reaching out to the IP address `127[.]26[.]152[.]13`.

![dll ip address](../../Images/lab01-01-dll-ip.png)

### Conclusions
Based on what we saw, we believe that these two programs may be working together for ransomware. The `.exe` file is scanning the system for files and unmapping the data locations for those files, but at the same time gathering information on where those files exist. It will probably then send that data to the IP address using the `.dll` file. Once the user has paid the ransom, the file location data can be sent back and restored.

## Lab 1-2
Objectives for the second sample of malware:
1. Upload the files to [Virtus Total](http://www.VirusTotal.com/) and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
2. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?
3. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?

### VirusTotal Results

Using HashMyFiles we were able to find the hashes of `Lab01-02.exe` 

![Lab01-02.exe hash](../../Images/hash%20lab01-02-exe.png)

Using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) we are able to use the search feature and copy and paste the MD5 hash of the file.

The `Lab01-02.exe` file got a hit:

![VirusTotal Lab01-02.exe](../../Images/VT%20lab01-02-exe.png)

### To Pack or not to Pack that is the question

Using PEID we can check to see if the file has been packed.

![lab01-02.exe peid packed](../../Images/lab01-02_peid.png)

We can see that it has indeed been packed using UPX. Looking at PEStudios we can also see in the signature line that it was packed.

![lab01-02.exe pestudio packed](../../Images/pestudio_lab01-02_packed.png)

We can also see that the headers for the sections have also been modified, which indicate packing.

![lab01-02.exe header packed](../../Images/lab01-02_header_packed.png)

### Imported Files

Looking at the imports on PEStudios: 

![libraries lab01-02](../../Images/libraries_lab01-02.png)

There doesn't seem to be that many imports, but remembering that this is a packed binary, we can unpack it using `upx -d <filename>`

![unpacked lab01-02](../../Images/lab01-02_unpacked.png)

Going back into PEStudios with the unpacked file we can see the imports:

![unpacked imports](../../Images/libraries_unpacked_lab01-02.png)

It seems that this piece of malware is opening up an Internet URL using `InternetOpenURL` (The A at the end will not show up in the documentation, but it stands for ascii). It is also creating a Service using `CreateService`.

### Other host- and network based indicators

Looking at the strings we can see a website `http://www[.]malwareanalysisbook[.]com`, which is more likely the URL that it is trying to open.

![lab01-02 url](../../Images/lab01-02_url.png)

Looking further into strings, we noticed the name `MalService`, which may be the service that the malware is attempting to create.

![lab01-02 service](../../Images/lab01-02_service.png)

## Lab 1-3
Objectives for the third sample of malware:
1. Upload the files to [Virtus Total](http://www.VirusTotal.com/) and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
2. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?
3. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?

### VirusTotal Results

Using HashMyFiles we were able to find the hashes of `Lab01-03.exe` 

![Lab01-03.exe hash](../../Images/lab01-03_hash.png)

Using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) we are able to use the search feature and copy and paste the MD5 hash of the file.

The `Lab01-03.exe` file got a hit:

![VirusTotal Lab01-03.exe](../../Images/VT_lab01-03.png)

### To Pack or not to Pack that is the question

Using PEID we can check to see if the file has been packed.

![lab01-03.exe peid packed](../../Images/lab01-03_peid.png)

We can see that it has indeed been packed using FSG 1.0. Looking at PEStudios we can also see in the signature line that it was packed.

![lab01-02.exe pestudio packed](../../Images/lab01-03_pestudio_packed.png)

We can also see that the headers for the sections have also been modified, which indicate packing.

![lab01-02.exe header packed](../../Images/lab01-03_section_headers.png)

### Imported Files

Because it is packed and we have not gone that far into the book on how to unpack FSG files, we get very limited views on the imports.

![lab01-03 imports](../../Images/lab01-03_imports.png)

### Other host- and network based indicators

Again because it is packed we have a limited view on information. Looking at the strings we find gibberish.

![lab01-03 strings](../../Images/lab01-03_strings.png)

## Lab 1-4
Objectives for the fourth sample of malware:
1. Upload the files to [Virtus Total](http://www.VirusTotal.com/) and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
2. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?
3. When was this program compiled?
4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
5. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?
6. This file has one resource in the resource section. Use Resource Hacker to examine that resource, and then use it to extract the
resource. What can you learn from the resource?
