# VirtualBox Install Instructions  
Start by going to the  [VirtualBox Website](https://www.virtualbox.org/)  

![vbox install](../Images/Virtualbox_website.png)  
  
After selecting the download box it will ask you what type of OS you are running. Select your OS and it will begin downloading the `.exe` file.

You should also go ahead and download the VM VirtualBox Extension Pack as shown in the image above.  

Once the download has completed, go ahead and run the `.exe` file.

Go ahead and walk through the Setup Wizard and then do the same for the Extension Pack. I already have some VMs installed, but you won't have any VMs present on the left window of your application.
