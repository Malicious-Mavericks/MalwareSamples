Start by downloading the ISO from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/WinXPProSP3x86) and selecting the ISO IMAGE download option.

We are using the x86 version (32-bit) because the samples from the textbook are 32-bit programs.  

Using VBox we start by creating a New VM. We name the VM and select where the ISO is located. The next screen will ask you to create a Username, Password, and add the product key located on the download website.

I then gave it 4 GB of memory, 2 CPUs, and 20 GB of disk space. I then selected finish and the VM started up. It starts to install Windows and follow the prompts that may pop up.
